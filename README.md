# Superstore Sales Dashboard + SQL Pitch Project

## Project Title
**Sales, Customer & Discount Dynamics: A Data-Driven Story using SQL + Tableau**

## Problem Statement
This project analyzes Superstoreâ€™s transactional data to evaluate sales, discounting patterns, profitability, regional dynamics, and key customers. The goal is to generate actionable insights for smarter pricing, customer targeting, and regional strategies.

## Methodology
- **SQL**: Data cleaning, aggregation, segmentation, and insights generation (queries included in `SQL_Scripts/` folder).
- **Tableau**: Built dynamic dashboards with filters on year, region, product line, and country to visualize sales, profit, discount trends, and customer contribution.
- **Connection**: Designed for live Tableau-MySQL connection using localhost on port 3306. Tableau Public used CSV extract due to platform limitations.

## Key Insights
- November peak sales month.
- Classic Cars: High-revenue but loss-making product line.
- EMEA: Strong sales, weak profitability.
- High discount bands erode profit despite boosting sales volume.
- Small set of customers drives majority of revenue.
